This solution is intentionally kept simple for the purposes of education and testing scenarios.


## Overview
Hey gang! Professor Feeser here. This repository is used to demo a webhook between GitHub and AAP via a video on my [YouTube Channel @CodeWithFeeser](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeWithFeeser). More broadly, it contains a simple playbook that debugs two simple messages to stdout:
  - "Github webhook from rzfeeser/aap-webhook! Instant real-time updates are GO!"
  - "Following Professor Feeser on Youtube via youtube.com/@CodeWithFeeser"


## Video Demos
Videos demonstrating use of this playbook in association with a GitHub webhook and Ansible Automation Platform is available on the author's [YouTube Channel @CodeWithFeeser](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeWithFeeser):

## How It Works
This is just a simple Ansible playbook that pushes some static strings to standard out when triggered. The magic is in **repo > Settings > Webhooks** and configuring a webhook, so that event data is delivered to Ansible Automation Platfrom (AAP) when events occur in GitHub.
